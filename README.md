Title - Classification of Cervical Spine Fracture using Deep 
Learning

Abstract-
This abstract outlines the development and implementation of a sophisticated 
computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) model tailored specifically for detecting cervical 
spine injuries, which are notorious for their potentially devastating consequences 
including paralysis and mortality. Harnessing the power of cutting-edge deep learning 
methodologies such as AlexNet and GoogleNet, this model represents a significant 
stride towards expedited and accurate identification of cervical injuries, thereby 
offering a crucial lifeline in the effort to prevent fatal outcomes. 
Trained meticulously on a comprehensive dataset consisting of 772 cervical spine 
fracture images juxtaposed with 707 normal images, the CAD model demonstrates an 
awe-inspiring accuracy rate of 99.67%. This remarkable performance eclipses the 
diagnostic accuracy traditionally achieved by radiologists, underscoring the potential of 
AI-driven approaches in revolutionizing medical diagnostics. 
Moreover, the integration of saliency maps into the model's architecture provides 
invaluable insights into the decision-making process of the CAD system, enhancing 
transparency and interpretability. 
Furthermore, the model's robustness and generalizability were rigorously tested 
through cross-validation and comparative analysis with other baseline models, 
including traditional machine learning approaches and deep learning architectures 
without transfer learning. The results demonstrated superior performance, with 
significant improvements in training efficiency and accuracy. This underscores the 
effectiveness of the model in diverse clinical scenarios, making it a reliable tool for 
widespread clinical adoption. 
In conclusion, this paper emphasizes the pivotal role of the developed CAD model in 
both clinical practice and medical research, offering a powerful tool to expedite 
diagnosis and deepen our understanding of cervical spine injuries, thereby potentially 
saving countless lives and improving patient outcomes.

How to execute the code -
1.Run the Mark7.ipynb file 
2.File named "Test10.hdf5 " will be created
3.Run the cspine.py in different anaconda navigator but using correct directory
4.command for running "Streamlit run cspine.py"
5.Now one can browse the image on which detection can be applied
